# RFM-Analysis-Using-SQL
RFM analysis project using T-SQL  that analyzes the behavior of customer groups using three metrics: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary; and how they make payments and segmented them according to that. The valuable insights obtained from the analysis impacted the Facebook Paid ads of the eCommerce(Shopify) client that resulted in predictable customer responses, improved interactions, and increased profits. Based on this analysis we also created remarketing audiences for Google Ads, email newsletters, and loyalty programs

Using NTILE(3) function assign customers to one of three groups, which are assigned a number from 1 to 10.

Customers with 10s in every category are the best customers of my clients.
